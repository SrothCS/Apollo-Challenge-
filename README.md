# Vehicle Management API
This project is a Vehicle Management API that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database of vehicle records. It provides RESTful endpoints to manage vehicle data such as adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving vehicle information.


## Features

- Retrieve All Vehicles: Fetch all vehicle records stored in the database.
- Retrieve a Vehicle by VIN: Fetch details of a specific vehicle using its unique VIN.
- Add a New Vehicle: Add a new vehicle record to the database.
- Update Vehicle Information: Modify details of an existing vehicle.
- Delete a Vehicle: Remove a vehicle record from the database.

## Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint           | Description                  |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET`       | `/vehicle`         | Fetch all vehicle records    |
| `POST`      | `/vehicle`         | Add a new vehicle record     |
| `GET`       | `/vehicle/{vin}`   | Fetch a vehicle by its VIN   |
| `PUT`       | `/vehicle/{vin}`   | Update an existing vehicle   |
| `DELETE`    | `/vehicle/{vin}`   | Delete a vehicle by its VIN  |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- PostgreSQL installed
- `curl` (optional, for testing the API)


### 2. Setting Up PostgreSQL
1. Log in as the `postgres` user:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```

2. Create the database and user:
   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE vehicles_db;
   CREATE USER vehicles_user WITH PASSWORD 'vehicles_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vehicles_db TO vehicles_user;
   ```

   than exit using:
   ```
   \q
   ```

3. Log into the database with created user:
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -U vehicles_user -d vehicles_db
   ```

4. Create the schema:
   ```bash
   CREATE SCHEMA vehicles_schema AUTHORIZATION vehicles_user;
   ```

5. Grant privileges:
   ```bash
   GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA vehicles_schema TO vehicles_user;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA vehicles_schema TO vehicles_user;
   ```

### 3. Clone and Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CommandLineAPI
   ```

2. Install dependencies and initialize the database:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Running the API

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   
2. Open a new terminal tab to run queries against the API.

### Example Queries Using `curl`

Fetch All Vehicles:

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle
```

Add a New Vehicle:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "vin": "1HGCM82633A123459",
    "manufacturer_name": "Lamborguini",
    "description": "A expensive cool car",
    "horse_power": 20000,
    "model_name": "huracan",
    "model_year": 2020,
    "purchase_price": 25000.99,
    "fuel_type": "Petrol"
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle
```


Fetch a Vehicle by VIN:

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle/1HGCM82633A123459
```

Update Vehicle Information:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "vin": "1HGCM82633A123459",
    "manufacturer_name": "Lamborguini",
    "description": "A expensive cool car",
    "horse_power": 20000,
    "model_name": "aventador",
    "model_year": 2020,
    "purchase_price": 25000.99,
    "fuel_type": "Petrol"
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle/1HGCM82633A123456

```



Delete a Vehicle:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/vehicle/1HGCM82633A123459
```

## Available Makefile Commands

| Command       | Description                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `make`        | Installs dependencies and initializes the database |
| `make run`    | Runs the Flask application                    |
| `make test`   | Runs example `curl` commands to test the API  |
| `make clean`  | Cleans the virtual environment and dependencies |

---

## Project Flow

1. **Set up PostgreSQL:** Follow the PostgreSQL setup instructions below to prepare the database.
2. **Run the Flask server:** Start the application using `make run`.
3. **Test API Endpoints:** Use the provided `curl` commands to add, fetch, update, or delete vehicle records.
4. **View Results:** Query the database to verify changes made by the API.

---

## Notes

- The VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a unique key for each vehicle.
- Ensure the Flask server is running in one terminal tab while using another terminal for curl queries.
- Errors will return JSON responses with detailed error messages.
